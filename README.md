# Store-Sales-Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis 
(EDA) on a comprehensive dataset obtained from the retail store. Through the analysis of 
this dataset, we aim to achieve the following goals: 

1. Gain a thorough understanding of customer demographics and purchasing behavior. 

2. Identify the most influential sales channels, product categories, and geographical 
locations. 

3. Determine the highest performing months and uncover any seasonality trends. 

4. Conduct hypothesis testing to validate assumptions and explore differences in key 
metrics. 

5. Provide the retail store with an annual sales report that offers actionable insights 
and data-driven recommendations for future decision-making. 

6. Transforming EDA results into a visual, interactive format. 

7. Enabling the retail store to easily access and analyze the annual sales report. 

8. Enhancing the decision-making process through data visualization.
